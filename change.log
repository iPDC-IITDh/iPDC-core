23.05.2012 : Fifth release, version 1.3.0

     Now ChangeLog, COPYING, and Release_note files are become common. Previously these three files have seprate copy in each individual folders.

	Changes in iPDC-1.3 :

	Bug Resolution :
               
          None.

	New Features:

          Now iPDC has a centralized file structure.
 
          Only a single file for each iPDC and that will store with iPDC-ID. File structure will be explained in release notes document.

          A setup file for a iPDC will contains the information about 
               	iPDC Server, 
               	Connected Source Devices, 
               	Connected Destination Devices, and 
               	finally configuration frames of sources. 

          Because of this single Setup File previously generated four local file will not be crated in the iPDC source folder, they are
               	pdc.txt
               	ipaddress.txt
               	upperpdc_ip.txt
               	cfg.bin  

	Now the iPDC setup is already saved and could be reload on restart of iPDC. The files are saved in $HOME~/iPDC/iPDC/ directory.

          Installation of iPDC will create folder name iPDC at /usr/local/share/iPDC & copy the four files into it, for global run
               	iPDC.xml
               	ipdcLogo.png
               	ipdcLogo1.png
               	PSLAB.PNG

          Now multiple iPDC can be run on single machine simultaneously through only single installation.

          User is able to view the Setup File before uploading on iPDC. 

          Setup File will only used for reloading. All operations are based on memory objects and only certain changes will lead to setup file access.


	No changes in DBServer-1.0.

               	PMU Server, and
               	Configuration frame. 

          Because of this single Setup File previously generated three local file will not be crated in the PMU Simulator source folder, they are
               	pmuServer.txt
               	cfg2.bin  
               	header.bin  

		Now the PMU Simulator setup is already saved and could be reload on restart of PMU. The files are saved in $HOME~/iPDC/PMU/ directory.

          Installation of PMU Simulator will create folder name PMU at /usr/local/share/PMU & copy the four files into it, for global run
               	pmu.xml
               	pmuLogo.png
		pmuLogo1.png
               	PSLab.PNG
